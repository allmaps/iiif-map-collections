# IIIF Map Collections

This repository contains a curated list of collections of scanned maps that can be accessed with [IIIF](https://iiif.io/). Currently, the list is very short.

View and edit the list here: [iiif-map-collections.yml](iif-map-collections.yml)

I'm using the map collections in this file to build and test tools that will make it easier and more fun to search, view and georeference maps on the web. For more information, see [my collection of Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@bertspaan/iiif-and-maps-an-introduction?collection=@bertspaan/iiif-maps).
